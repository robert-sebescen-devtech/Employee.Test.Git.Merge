Git Merge Challenge Task

Purpose of this repository is to test your merging skills for DEVTECH's Challenge 2016.

In order to do so you will need to do the following:
- Create GitHub account (if you do not have one)
- Fork this repository with you GitHub account
- Merge "allCapsedNames" and "excludeShortFirstNames" branches (not necessarily in this order) into the master branch on your account's repository
- Create pull request for your repository's master branch into this repository's master branch

In order for you to better understand what has been commited on these branches read the storyline bellow.

Initially there was a need to retrieve people's names. As it always happen, this was not the final implementation (http://goo.gl/J5P2PW).
Two developers, John and Mike, are working on this project. 
Project manager have assigned one task for each of the developers.
Both of them created new branch from master branch and started implementing their tasks.

John's task: "We hate worrying about the casing in the people's names, make them all upper cased!"
Mike's task: "Please exclude people who's first name is shorted than 4 letters because of reasons... One of them being that I am your manager and I(!) want you to do so!"

They both have successfully completed their tasks, but the manager could not see these changes because they were not on the master branch.

Your task is to fork this repository, merge these branches into master branch on your repository and create a pull request.

Cheers

Note: If you fail at your first attempt you can commit new changes and try again (and again, and again...).
